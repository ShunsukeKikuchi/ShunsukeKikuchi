# Hi there!

My name is Shunsuke Kikuchi! I'm a 2nd year transfer student at UCLA, pursuing a double major in Computational & Systems Biology, with a focus on the Dynamical Modeling track, and Applied Mathematics. 
Currently I'm working at Dr. Xia Yang Lab and involving in a project about machine learning model for predicitng Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). 
Besides the lab project, I'm enjoying Kaggle competitions! I'm setting my rule to participate in at least 1 AI competition at a time, including any other competition platform or conference challenges.

### Current Projects
#### Lab project: 
- [scGRNdb](https://github.com/XiaYangLabOrg/scNetworkAtlas.git): scGRNdb is an analysis pipeline for single-cell and spatial-transcritptomics data via GRNs. It will be an interactive web server, comming soon!
#### AI competitions
- [CMI24](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use): challenge for analyzing children's physical activity data to detect early indicators of problematic internet and technology use. Close at the end of the year, long run project
- [JSCAS](https://github.com/modafone/jscasaichallenge2024): JSCAS (Japan Society fo Computer Assisted Surgery) held challnege session. This year, we solve 3 tasks about videos during IMA (Internal Mammary Artery) bypass surgical operation.

### Past Projects (24')
#### Lab project
- [SCING](https://github.com/XiaYangLabOrg/SCING): SCING is a machine-learning model predicting GRNs from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. I was involved in validation of the model and customiztaion of community detection algorithm for our GRNs.
#### AI comeptitions
- MICCAI Endovis Challenge: Final result will be come out Oct. 10 at MICCAI Challenge Day. Hope see you there!
    - [SegCol](https://github.com/JmeesInc/SegColChallenge.git): Competing in Semantic segmentation for Tools and Fold Edges in Colonoscopy video, and active learning on the baseline model given by the organizer. 
    - [OSS](https://github.com/JmeesInc/OpenSuturingSkillsChallenge.git): Evaluation model for open suturing skills of student training video.
    - [STIR](https://github.com/JmeesInc/STIR-Challenge.git): Deformable point tracking on STIR Dataset videos. 2D, and stero 3d tracking.
- [Leash-Bio BELKA](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leash-BELKA: Binding prediction of organic molecules to 3 proteins, BRD4, HSA and sEH. Our team got silver prize with robust performance on both public (8/1950) and private (27/1950).
