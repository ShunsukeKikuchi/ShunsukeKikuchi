# Hi there!

My name is Shunsuke Kikuchi! I'm a 2nd year transfer student at UCLA, pursuing a double major in Computational & Systems Biology, with a focus on the Dynamical Modeling track, and Applied Mathematics. 
Currently I'm working at Dr. Xia Yang Lab and involving in a project about machine learning model for predicitng Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). 
Besides the lab project, I'm enjoying Kaggle competitions! I'm setting my rule to participate in at least 1 AI competition at a time, including any other competition platform or conference challenges.
