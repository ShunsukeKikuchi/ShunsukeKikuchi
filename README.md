# Hi there!

My name is **Shunsuke Kikuchi**! I'm a second-year transfer student at **UCLA**, pursuing a double major in **Computational & Systems Biology**, with a track of Dynamical Modeling, and **Applied Mathematics**. 
I'm currently working in [Dr. Xia Yang's Lab](https://yanglab.ibp.ucla.edu/) on a project involving a machine learning model for predicting Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). 
Besides the lab project, I enjoy participating in **Kaggle** competitions! I make my rule to take part in at least one AI competition at a time, including other competition platforms or conference challenges.

**Interests** : Bioinformatics🧬, Computational Medicine📊, Network Science🌐<br>
**Hobby** : Running🏃, Manga/Anime📚 (fav: Girls' Last Tour)<br>
**Food** : Ramen🍜, Eel🐟, Taco🌮<br>
**Cats** : 2 Pets🐈<br>

### Current Projects
#### Research: 
- [scGRNdb](https://github.com/XiaYangLabOrg/scNetworkAtlas.git): scGRNdb is an analysis pipeline for single-cell and spatial-transcriptomics data via GRNs. We are constructing an interactive web server, coming soon!
-  Temporal Memory Augmentation Module: We develop a module for trained Encoder-Decoder segmentation model to handle time-series information without training by amount of data, by attaching memory attention module. Submitted to MICCAI25.  
#### AI competitions
- [CZII](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/czii-cryo-et-object-identification): Challenge to detect diverse protein complexes (biological particles with well-defined structures) in 3D cellular image. This long-term project ends at the beginning of Feb.
### Past Projects (24')
#### Research
- [SCING](https://github.com/XiaYangLabOrg/SCING): SCING is a machine-learning model predicting GRNs from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. I contributed to the validation of the model and customization of the community detection algorithm for our GRNs.
#### AI comeptitions
