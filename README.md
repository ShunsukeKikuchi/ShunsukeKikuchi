# Hi there!

My name is **Shunsuke Kikuchi**! I'm a second-year transfer student at **UCLA**, pursuing a double major in **Computational & Systems Biology**, with a track of Dynamical Modeling, and **Applied Mathematics**. 
I'm currently working in [Dr. Xia Yang's Lab](https://yanglab.ibp.ucla.edu/) on a project involving a machine learning model for predicting Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). 
Besides the lab project, I enjoy participating in **Kaggle** competitions! I make my rule to take part in at least one AI competition at a time, including other competition platforms or conference challenges.
<br>
<br>
**Interests** : Bioinformatics🧬, Computational Medicine📊, Network Science🌐<br>
**Hobby** : Running🏃, Manga/Anime📚 (favorite: Girls' Last Tour)<br>
**Cats** : 2 Pets🐈<br>

### Current Projects
#### Research: 
- [scGRNdb](https://github.com/XiaYangLabOrg/scNetworkAtlas.git): scGRNdb is an analysis pipeline for single-cell and spatial-transcritptomics data via GRNs. It will be an interactive web server, comming soon!
#### AI competitions
- [CMI24](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-problematic-internet-use): challenge for analyzing children's physical activity data to detect early indicators of problematic internet and technology use. Close at the end of the year.
- [JSCAS](https://github.com/modafone/jscasaichallenge2024): JSCAS (Japan Society fo Computer Assisted Surgery) held challnege session. This year, we solve 3 tasks about videos during IMA (Internal Mammary Artery) bypass surgical operation.

### Past Projects (24')
#### Research
- [SCING](https://github.com/XiaYangLabOrg/SCING): SCING is a machine-learning model predicting GRNs from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. I was involved in validation of the model and customiztaion of community detection algorithm for our GRNs.
#### AI comeptitions
- MICCAI Endovis Challenge: Final result will be come out Oct. 10 at MICCAI Challenge Day. Hope see you there!
    - [SegCol](https://github.com/JmeesInc/SegColChallenge.git): Competing in Semantic segmentation for Tools and Fold Edges in Colonoscopy video, and active learning on the baseline model given by the organizer. 
    - [OSS](https://github.com/JmeesInc/OpenSuturingSkillsChallenge.git): Evaluation model for open suturing skills of student training video.
    - [STIR](https://github.com/JmeesInc/STIR-Challenge.git): Deformable point tracking on STIR Dataset videos. 2D, and stero 3d tracking.
- [Leash-Bio BELKA](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leash-BELKA): Binding prediction of organic molecules to 3 proteins, BRD4, HSA and sEH. Our team got silver prize with robust performance on both public (8/1950) and private (27/1950). I did CV strategy and some ideas to avoid overfitting. See our [solution report](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leash-BELKA/discussion/519191)
- [HMS](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification): Detection for dangerous brain wave patterns using EEG data. I did everything other than some part of evaluation.
- [6th National Medical Ai Contest in Japan](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/medical-ai-contest2024/overview): Segmentation on a large organ segmentation dataset, Totalsegmentator. got 4th prize ($100).
